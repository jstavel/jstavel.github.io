title: What my family taught me
---

Hi all,

I work for National Library of Czech Republic as a lead programmer.
I have been working from home for two years now.
And it is worth writing what I learned from it.

How to stay focused if you have a family around you?

Hm.

How to motivate myself to go ahead in a project?

Hm.

It is meaningful to be at home if you have a family.
Believe me!

## Stay focused

I live in a [small vilage](http://www.pasovice.cz) in a house with a large garden.
There is a lot of work you can do!

I have three children. There are so many opportunities to enjoy with
them!

Do you know the feeling if you close some task as finished?
I is pretty nice feeling. And if you use github issues it is marveolus! Green check at a issue looks great!

So I want to be concetrated to finish my work. Do you rememeber small children love noises? You can make noise ssss, ssss. It makes them to be relaxed, calm them.

Nice! So I took 20minutes of "Noise of storm at the river" from youtube.

I have a problem with our dogs. They are keen on travelling around our
village. I do not want them to do it.

A solution comes to me - after each 20minutes of my work I call to our
dogs and rub them.

So my working day is - listening to 20minutes of "Storm at the river"
noise, rubbing the dogs at a pause. I managed to solve those problems together!
 
## My motivation

It is depressing to see a goal somewhere in a future. And the goals is
the same, no change you see.

[The now habit](http://www.amazon.com/The-Now-Habit-Overcoming-Procrastination/dp/1585425524)
 book helped me to ask myself the right way.

What is your goal? The book taught me to ask myself: "What can you do
now for you to be happy?" Now and here?

If you answer this question your working days are full of success.

## My goals at a project

Sometimes I felt my family does thing that I do not understand. Is it
wrong the things are evolving another way I think?

No! If eachone of your team hase the same goal the things go well! It is important. 

## Github isses page helps a lot

Our team is spread over Czech Republic. Issues at github are great way to communicate with other team members.
Eventhought they are not programmers it is easy to publish there for them.
Great way to communicate. Sure!

## Do not give up!

Working from home offers you a lot of challenges and it is an adventurous way. Trust me!
So that is why I want to try to work as freelancer. I will talk to someone from [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/python) next week. I am looking forward to the talk. Great!
