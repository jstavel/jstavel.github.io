title: What my family taught me
---

Hi all,

I work for National Library of Czech Republic.
I have worked already two years from home.
And it is worth to write what I learned from it.

How to stay focused if you have a family that is happy you are with
it?

Hm.

How to motivate myself to step toward in a project?

Hm.

It is worth to be at home if you have family.
Believe me!

## Stay focused
