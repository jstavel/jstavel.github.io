title: What my family taught me
---

Hi all,

I work for National Library of Czech Republic.
I have worked already two years from home.
And it is worth to write what I learned from it.

How to stay focused if you have a family that is happy you are with
it?

Hm.

How to motivate myself to step toward in a project?

Hm.

It is worth to be at home if you have family.
Believe me!

## Stay focused

I live at a [small vilage](http://www.pasovice.cz) in a house with large garden.
There are a lot of work you can do!

I have three children. There are so much opportunities to enjoy with
them!

Do you know the feeling if you close some task as finished?
I is pretty nice feeling. And if you use github issues it is marveous! Green check at a issue looks great!

So I want to be concetrated to finish my work. Do you rememeber small children loves noises? You can make noise ssss, ssss. It makes them to be relaxed, calm them.

Nice! So I took 20minutes of "Noise of storm at the river".

[The now habit](http://www.amazon.com/The-Now-Habit-Overcoming-Procrastination/dp/1585425524)
 book helped me.
 
## My motivation

## My goals at a project

To work from home offers you a lot of challenges and it is adventurous way. Trust me!
So that is why I want to try to work as freelancer. I will talk to someone from toptal.com next week. I am looking forward to the talk. Great!
