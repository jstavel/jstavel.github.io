title: What my family taught me
---

Hi all,

I work for National Library of Czech Republic as a lead programmer.
I have worked already two years from home.
And it is worth to write what I learned from it.

How to stay focused if you have a family that is happy you are with
it?

Hm.

How to motivate myself to step toward in a project?

Hm.

It is worth to be at home if you have family.
Believe me!

## Stay focused

I live at a [small vilage](http://www.pasovice.cz) in a house with large garden.
There are a lot of work you can do!

I have three children. There are so much opportunities to enjoy with
them!

## My motivation

## My goals at a project

## Github isses page helps a lot

Our team is spread over Czech Republic. Issues at github is great way to communicate with other team members.
Even they are not programmers it is easy to publish there.
Great way to communicate. Sure!
